//Write a program that will help kids learn divisibly test of numbers of integers. The program should check whether the given integer is divisible by integers in the range of 0-9. For example, if a number (955) is divisible by five, the program should print, the number is divisible by 5 because it ends with a 5, and 900 is divisible by 5 because it ends with a 0(zero).
